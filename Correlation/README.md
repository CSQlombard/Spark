# Pearson Correlation of Occurrence Ratios

The codes in this folder compute the Pearson correlation of the occurence ratio of all words against a chosen word.

Follow "1_gram_correlation_analysis_git.py" to load the data and apply the necessary transformations.
The output saved as .csv will be used to generate the plots.

"plot_correlations.py" uses the saved ouput.csv to plot different words belonging to output.csv.

I also uploaded some plots generated with these codes, see pdfs.
